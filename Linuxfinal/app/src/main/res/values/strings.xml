    <string name="history"><b>Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish
        student Linus Torvalds: to create a new free operating system kernel.The resulting
        Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history.Since the
        initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C
        files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in
        2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments,[1]
        under the GNU General Public License v2.Linux is an operating system in much the
        same way that windows is an opearting system.The term operating system is used to
        describe the software that acts as layer between the hardware in a computer and
        applications that we all run on a daily basis.
